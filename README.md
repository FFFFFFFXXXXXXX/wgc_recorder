# WGC_RECORDER

## Windows Graphics Capture API - Recorder

**!!!this library only works on windows!!!** 

This library provides a Recorder struct with which a window can be recorded.

The code in this library implements the sample code from [the microsoft docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/audio-video-camera/screen-capture-video)
The code/structure is **heavily** inspired by [Robert Mikhayelyans](https://github.com/robmikh) public projects.
